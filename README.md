# password-randomizer-redeux

As I continue my coding journey I am going back through my coursework and working through the material again. This was the first homework assigment that involved writing actual logic. I remember doing this assignment the first time around and the hours it took me to write the code out. I remember flooding the screen with code and while my code was infact successful in its purpouse I remember thinking I would really like to condense this in the future. So I took the oppertunity this time around. I dropped the code from about 100 lines to 60. Its nice to be able to look back and see signs of progress.
